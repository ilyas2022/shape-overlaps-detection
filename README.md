## Project Overview

This project implements a system to dynamically generate and display various geometric shapes (Circles, Regular Polygons, and Irregular Polygons) and detect overlaps between them. The backend is built with Spring Boot, handling shape generation and collision logic, while the frontend provides a simple canvas-based visualization.

The primary goal is to implement accurate overlap detection algorithms and to document the project thoroughly, serving as a student portfolio piece.

## Features

- **Dynamic Shape Generation:** Create random circles, regular polygons, and irregular polygons with varying sizes and positions.
- **Overlap Detection:**
    - Circle-Circle collision.
    - Circle-Polygon collision.
    - Polygon-Polygon collision (using Separating Axis Theorem - SAT).
- **Visual Feedback:** Overlapping groups of shapes are highlighted with distinct colors.
- **Interactive Controls:** Adjust parameters like maximum radius, shape count, and maximum edges for polygons.
- **JSON Data Display:** View the raw JSON data generated by the backend, including shape properties and overlap groups.
- **Union-Find for Grouping:** Efficiently groups transitive overlaps (if A overlaps B, and B overlaps C, then A, B, C are in the same group).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or later.
- Gradle (usually handled by the Gradle wrapper `gradlew`).
- Git for cloning the repository.

### Running the Application

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ilyas2022/shape-overlaps-detection.git
    cd shape-overlaps-detection
    ```

2.  **Run the application using Gradle:**
    - On Linux/macOS:
      ```bash
      ./gradlew bootRun
      ```
    - On Windows:
      ```bash
      .\gradlew.bat bootRun
      ```

3.  **Access the application:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.

## Algorithm Highlights

- **Separating Axis Theorem (SAT):** Used for robust polygon-polygon collision detection. It works by checking for a separating axis between two convex polygons. If no such axis exists, the polygons are overlapping.
- **Circle-Polygon Collision:** Handled by checking:
    1. If any polygon vertex is inside the circle.
    2. If the circle's center is inside the polygon.
    3. If any polygon edge intersects the circle.
- **Union-Find Algorithm:** Implemented in `ShapeGenerator.java` to efficiently identify connected components of overlapping shapes, ensuring that transitive overlaps are grouped and colored correctly.
